<h1>A0: Chronology &amp; Case Summary</h1>

<h2>Employment Context</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Position:</strong> General Manager (GM), Platzki Ltd, 229 Deansgate, Manchester</li>
  <li><strong>Employment Period:</strong> 1 January 2025 - 13 October 2025 (9 months + 13 days)</li>
  <li><strong>Contracted Monthly Salary (net):</strong> GBP 2,800/month</li>
  <li><strong>Tronc/Tips (average):</strong> GBP 550/month (pro-rata from payslip data)</li>
  <li><strong>Contract Basis:</strong> Permanent, full-time, subject to ACAS procedures</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline of Key Events</h2>

<h3>11 October 2025 (Saturday) - Medical Emergency &amp; Cover Arranged</h3>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Claimant's close friend Marek Piszczek required urgent hospital transport due to medical emergency.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>13:27-14:03:</strong> Uber trip to Royal Preston Hospital (medical records).</li>
  <li><strong>14:26-14:31:</strong> Claimant attempts to reach employer Lukasz (phone calls logged).</li>
  <li><strong>14:35-15:57:</strong> WhatsApp operational messages coordinating cover.</li>
  <li><strong>15:14-15:23:</strong> Contact with Anastasia (staff member); confirmed arrival 16:30-17:00.</li>
  <li><strong>15:29:</strong> Claimant email to employer regarding early departure.</li>
</ul>

<div class="quote-box">
  <div class="quote-header">Email: Early Departure Notification (Cover Arranged)</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Reference: E0-EMAIL-001 | Date: 11/10/2025 15:29</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Verbatim Text (Original)</div>
  <div class="quote-verbatim">
    "I started work today at 11:40 and plan to leave at approximately 16:30, not before Anastasia arrives to take over the shift. Before leaving, I did everything I could to organise proper cover. As requested, I have left the company laptop on the premises."
  </div>
  <div class="quote-metadata">
    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 11/10/2025 15:29
    <br/>
    <strong>Context:</strong> Claimant notifies of departure; confirms cover arrangement (Anastasia arriving 16:30-17:00); confirms operational continuity (laptop on premises).
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> ERA s.57A (time off for dependants - notice given); Contract performance (cover provided); Factual foundation for "moving goalposts" dispute.
  </div>
</div>

<h3>11 October 2025 (Evening) - Employer Rejects "Authorisation" &amp; Escalates</h3>

<p><strong>Employer's response sequence - NEW RULE INTRODUCED:</strong></p>

<div class="quote-box">
  <div class="quote-header">Email: Rejection of Cover / Introduction of "Not Authorised"</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Reference: E0-EMAIL-002 | Date: 11/10/2025 15:38</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Verbatim Text (Original)</div>
  <div class="quote-verbatim">
    "this was not authorised in advance. I organised the shift cover myself to ensure continuity of operations - not you."
  </div>
  <div class="quote-metadata">
    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 11/10/2025 15:38 (9 minutes after Claimant's email)
    <br/>
    <strong>Critical Analysis:</strong> FIRST use of term "not authorised" in response. Operative standard had been "cover" (which was arranged). This is "moving the goalposts."
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> Breach of contract (novel rule ex post facto); Misrepresentation (denying Claimant's role in cover arrangement); Predetermination signal.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
  <div class="quote-header">Email: Misstatement of Law &amp; Immediate Demand (Card Return)</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Reference: E0-EMAIL-003 | Date: 11/10/2025 16:05-16:08</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Verbatim Text (Original)</div>
  <div class="quote-verbatim">
    "Emergencies involving friends are not covered under UK employment law for time off for dependants. Please bring the company card back to the restaurant and leave it in a secure place today."
  </div>
  <div class="quote-metadata">
    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 11/10/2025 16:05-16:08
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Error:</strong> Employer asserts false law. ERA 1996 s.57A defines "dependant" broadly: "(a) a spouse, child or parent of the employee, or (b) a person who reasonably relies on the employee for care." Marek Piszczek qualifies: no family in UK; years of close relationship; reasonable reliance established (Claimant called; organised transport).
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> Misstatement of law (ERA s.57A); Evidence of pretextual basis; Bad faith; Supports finding of unfair dismissal (s.98(4) ERA - reason given is false).
  </div>
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
  <div class="quote-header">Email: Escalation / Formal Notice of Disciplinary Process</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Reference: E0-EMAIL-004 | Date: 11/10/2025 20:44</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Verbatim Text (Original)</div>
  <div class="quote-verbatim">
    "You did not have authorisation to leave. It was me who organised the cover. This matter will be addressed formally. The company card must be returned today."
  </div>
  <div class="quote-metadata">
    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 11/10/2025 20:44 (5+ hours after initial response)
    <br/>
    <strong>Pattern Analysis:</strong> Third email same day; escalated tone. Repeats false claim ("I organised cover" - contradicted by Claimant's email and WhatsApp evidence). Signals formal draconian process coming ("addressed formally"). Repeats card demand (now mandatory "today").
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> Predetermination; Misrepresentation (denying Claimant's cover role); Coercion; ACAS Code breach imminent (pattern of procedural threats).
  </div>
</div>

<h3>12 October 2025 (Sunday) - Disciplinary Invitation; Employer Rejects Objections</h3>

<div class="quote-box">
  <div class="quote-header">Email: Disciplinary Meeting Invitation (Short Notice; No Pre-Disclosure)</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Reference: E0-INV-001 | Date: 12/10/2025 11:55</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Verbatim Text (Original)</div>
  <div class="quote-verbatim">
    "Date: Monday, 13 October 2025 - Time: 1:00 p.m. Concerns: Leaving your shift early without prior authorisation, misrepresentation, failure to return company card. The meeting will be conducted in Polish. Translation or summaries will be provided where necessary. Relevant documentation and evidence will be presented during the hearing itself."
  </div>
  <div class="quote-metadata">
    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 12/10/2025 11:55 (Sunday; less than 24 hours notice for hearing)
    <br/>
    <strong>Procedural Issues:</strong> Invitation sent Sunday for Monday hearing - less than 24 hours' notice. ACAS Code guidance recommends minimum 48 hours. Language: Polish (potential communication barrier). CRITICAL: "evidence will be presented during the hearing itself" - NO PRE-DISCLOSURE of evidence to allow Claimant preparation.
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> ACAS Code breaches (§12-14 insufficient notice; §2 no pre-disclosure); s.98(4) ERA (procedural unfairness); Language barrier potential (s.20-21 EqA).
  </div>
</div>

<div class="quote-box">

  <div class="quote-label">Verbatim Text (Original)</div>
  <div class="quote-verbatim">
    "As you were directly involved in the incident and Przemek - your husband and co-owner - it would not be possible to consider the process impartial. The notice does not meet the minimum reasonable timeframe. Evidence must be shared in advance."
  </div>
  <div class="quote-metadata">
    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 12/10/2025 15:29 (3+ hours after invitation)
    <br/>
    <strong>Objections Raised:</strong> (1) Impartiality - chair (Lukasz) directly involved in 11/10 dispute; co-chair (Przemek, husband/co-owner) - no separation of roles. (2) Notice - less than 24 hours insufficient for fair preparation. (3) Disclosure - evidence must be shared in advance (ACAS Code §2 requirement).
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> ACAS Code §6 (impartiality); §12-14 (notice); §2 (disclosure); Professional procedural complaint by Claimant.
  </div>

  <div class="quote-verbatim">
    "I will conduct the hearing, and Przemek will also be present. This is standard practice in small businesses. Relevant documentation and evidence will be presented and discussed during the hearing itself. The meeting will proceed as scheduled (13 Oct, 13:00)."
  </div>
  <div class="quote-metadata">
    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 12/10/2025 15:48 (19 minutes after Claimant's objection)
    <br/>
    <strong>Response Analysis:</strong> Employer rejects impartiality concern ("standard practice in small businesses" - not ACAS standard). Rejects pre-disclosure (evidence "during the hearing itself" - reinforces ACAS Code §2 breach). Confirms hearing proceeds as scheduled - no accommodation of concerns.
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> ACAS Code breach confirmed (§6, §2, §12-14); Procedural unfairness (s.98(4) ERA); Predetermination signal (no genuine consideration of objections).
  </div>

<h3>13 October 2025 (Monday) - Fit Note; Refusal to Postpone; 66-Minute Hearing; Dismissal</h3>

<div class="quote-box">
  <div class="quote-header">Email: Claimant's Health Disclosure (Fit Note; Regular Day Off)</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Reference: E0-EMAIL-INABILITY | Date: 13/10/2025 11:50</div>
  <div class="quote-label">Verbatim Text (Original)</div>
  <div class="quote-verbatim">
    "The disciplinary meeting has been scheduled on my regular day off. I have been signed off work by my GP due to stress (fit note attached) from 13/10/2025 to 13/11/2025. I am unable to attend the meeting as scheduled."
  </div>
  <div class="quote-metadata">
    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 13/10/2025 11:50 (70 minutes before scheduled hearing at 13:00)
    <br/>
    <strong>Health Disclosure:</strong> Claimant discloses: (1) Hearing scheduled on regular day off (operational context). (2) GP has issued fit note for stress (covers 13/10-13/11). (3) Attached fit note as evidence. (4) States "unable to attend" - implicitly requesting adjustment (postponement).
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> s.20-21 EqA (reasonable adjustments trigger - known health condition); s.15 EqA (discrimination arising from disability - stress); ACAS Code §10-15 (duty to consider health when scheduling); Contemporaneous notice of health issue.
  </div>

  <div class="quote-metadata">
    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 12:01 (reply) | 12:49 (confirmation) - both same day, less than 1 hour before hearing
    <br/>
    <strong>Breach Analysis:</strong> Employer categorically refuses to postpone. Does NOT offer reasonable adjustments: remote attendance, written evidence submission, postponement to post-fit-note period. Fit note explicitly indicates "stress" - relevant to ADHD context (medical file shows ongoing ADHD treatment). Proceeding despite clear health disclosure breaches s.20-21 EqA.
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> Breach of s.20-21 EqA (failure to make reasonable adjustments); s.15 EqA (discrimination arising from disability - stress); ACAS Code breach (duty to consider health); Procedural unfairness (s.98(4) ERA).
  </div>

  <div class="quote-verbatim">
    "Outcome of Disciplinary Hearing - Dismissal. Allegations considered: leaving without official authorisation, misleading statements about cover, failure to return company card. Procedural challenge without basis, aimed at delaying the disciplinary process. Your employment will therefore end on 13 October 2025.

  </div>
  <div class="quote-metadata">
    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 13/10/2025 14:06 (66 minutes after scheduled 13:00 start time)
    <br/>
    <strong>Timing Analysis:</strong> 13:00 scheduled start to 14:06 dismissal sent = 66 minutes. For complex disciplinary involving multiple allegations, this is insufficient and indicative of predetermination.
    <br/>
    <strong>Critical Finding:</strong> Employer characterizes Claimant's ACAS Code objections (impartiality, notice, disclosure) as "procedural challenge without basis, aimed at delaying the disciplinary process" - contradicts fairness principle.
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> s.98(4) ERA (procedural unfairness); ACAS Code breach (summarized); Mischaracterization of Claimant's procedural objections; Appeal wording ambiguity (5 working days "of receiving" - will trigger 21/10 dispute).
  </div>

    <br/>
    <strong>Public Humiliation:</strong> Public announcement to all staff (group WhatsApp) same day as dismissal. NO PRIOR PRIVATE NOTIFICATION to Claimant. Claimant learns of own termination from group message or only after group becomes aware.
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> Breach of implied term of mutual trust and confidence (contract law); EqA s.26 (Harassment - public humiliation); Breach of dignity (common law); Aggravated damages (breach of care in dismissal communication); Breach of ACAS Code (§3 communication standards).

    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> EqA s.26 (Harassment - pressure during health crisis/vulnerable period); ERA s.13 coercion (implied deduction threat); Post-termination penalty (aggravated damages); Breach of goodwill.

    <strong>Calculation Error:</strong> Employer asserts deadline of 20/10 23:59. Dismissal letter states "within 5 working days OF RECEIVING this letter". Claimant received letter 16/10. 5 working days from 16/10 = 23/10/2025. Employer's calculation (from 13/10 send date) is incorrect - "of receiving" means from receipt date, not send date. Claimant's appeal notice filed 17/10 (within correct deadline).
    <br/>
    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> ACAS Code §4 breach (frustration of genuine right of appeal); Procedural unfairness (s.98(4) ERA); Misinterpretation of contractual term; Bad faith (employer counts from send date, not receipt).

CRITICAL: No deductions shown for equipment (locks, keys, scanner, charger), despite employer threats/claims of GBP 530 total value. This suggests employer did not actually apply deductions to final payment.

    <strong>Legal Significance:</strong> Evidence that unlawful deduction threat was not implemented to final payment; nonetheless, threats were made and constitute coercion under ERA s.13.

    <strong>Date/Time:</strong> 14/10/2025 (equipment demands); 17/10/2025 (formal letter)

    <strong>Context:</strong> Post-dismissal, employer sends formal letter threatening: (1) Deduction from final wages of disputed equipment values. (2) If total exceeds certain threshold, pursue civil claim (Small Claims Court). (3) 24-hour return ultimatum. Final payment document (04/11) shows NO deduction actually applied. Therefore, threat was made but not executed.

<h2>A1.4 Legal Analysis (ERA s.13 &amp; s.23)</h2>

<p><strong>ERA 1996 s.13 - Unlawful Deductions:</strong> An employer shall not make deductions from wages unless:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Authorised by written contract, OR</li>
  <li>Authorised by statute, OR</li>
  <li>Agreed in writing by the employee.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Application to this case:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No contractual clause:</strong> Employment contract (CP-01) contains NO clause authorising deduction for equipment loss/damage.</li>
  <li><strong>No statutory authority:</strong> No statute authorises employer to deduct equipment values from wages.</li>
  <li><strong>No written agreement:</strong> Claimant did NOT agree to deduction. Employer unilaterally "declared" values and threatened deduction.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Any deduction attempted (or threatened) violates ERA s.13 and ERA s.23 (restriction on contracting out of rights).</p>

<h2>A1.5 Relief Sought (A1)</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> All wages due for 1-13 October 2025 were lawfully paid in accordance with contract (no unlawful deduction made).</li>
  <li><strong>Declaration:</strong> Any post-dismissal threat to deduct equipment values is unlawful under ERA s.13.</li>
  <li><strong>Injunction (interim):</strong> Employer is prohibited from making any such deduction from future payments, pension, or benefits.</li>
  <li><strong>Statutory interest:</strong> On any established underpayment, at 8% per annum from the date of underpayment (from 13/10/2025).</li>
  <li><strong>Costs &amp; expenses:</strong> Legal and tribunal fees incurred in defence of unlawful deduction threat.</li>
